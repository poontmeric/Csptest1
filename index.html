  <p>Hey guys its me Eric here, I am doing a documentary on Eric Poon.
  through social media he's acting very queer. Unlike his old self, he's more active and disapproves video games.
  I contacted him a few times before through social media platforms, like Instagram @eric_mrf.
  Luckly Eric Poon agreed to do a interview with me about his life.
  Throughout our conversation, I've only told him I would be doing an interview for a school project about his life,
  but he doesn't know that the fundamental of the interview is to see if he has a mental illness,
  or a mental breakdown leading to his xbox profile being offline for 3 months.
