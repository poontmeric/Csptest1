    </b>
  <p>Introductory 
  <p>Who is Eric Poon? Is he just a regular student attending Lynnwood High School?
  <p>Ethnicity:Asian
  <hr>
  <p>Nationality: American.
  <hr>
  <p> Birth:Seattle Washington at Swedish Hospital.
  <p> Eric has multiple nicknames he is mainly known as Pooneri. 
  <p> Eric enjoys all his classes in school, but enjoys Computer Science the most. He thinks Computer Science could be a possible career, and would definitely study the major in College.
  <hr>
  <p>Hey guys its me Eric here, I am doing a documentary on Eric Poon.
  Through social media he's acting very queer. Unlike his old self, he's more active and disapproves video games.
  I contacted him a few times before through social media platforms, like Instagram @eric_mrf.
  Luckly Eric Poon agreed to do a interview with me about his life.
  Throughout our conversation, I've only told him I would be doing an interview for a school project about his life,
  but he doesn't know that the main point of the interview is to see if he has a mental illness,
  or a mental breakdown leading to his Xbox profile being offline for 3 months.

<p>On December 17th of 2018, Eric invited me to his Birthday party to do his interview. 
  it was his 15th birthday and he was allowed to invite one friend according to his parents, and I was that friend. 
  I asked him if I could bring a friend as an excuse to record the discussion, but the "Friend" I brought is a Psychiatrist 
  who knows if a person has mental illness. At that moment Eric was confused, but eventually agreed to record his interview.
  It was a sunny afternoon as I approach the door of Eric's house and slowly knocked on it. I could hear him stomping down the stairs 
  to greet me and my Psychiatrist. With manners we gave each other handshakes as a greeting, but his grip was strong and his smile
  was weak. As I walked in, he told me to take of my shoes and leave on the rack, he also offered to take my coat of and 
  hunged it on a coat hanger. He showed me around the house from room to kitchen and I thought to myself, his house is big but his room
  is small, small and cramped where he would lay in a corner when he is depressed. I asked him to excuse me to one of his restrooms and 
  brought my Psychiatrist with me. The Psychiatrist started listing things like, Eric's room, his greeting, and his expression. 
  Five minutes later...
  Eric sat me and my recorder down to start his interview. I din't want to attack his mind so quickly, so I started asking basic question
  like what's his favorite hobbies. His response was normal and had no hints related to depression. 
  Two days before...
  The Psychiatrist told me the five steps to approach a possible mental victim. 
 <p> 1.Ask the victim he/she favorite hobbies
 <p> 2.Stay calm with the victim and start approaching with questions that are related to their cause
 <p>3.Ask the victim about to share any depressing stories that could be hurting them
 <p> 4.Tell the victim the reason of the interview
 <p> 5.Thank the victim for their time
    </p> 
  Back to the interview...
  For about two hours I completed the five steps and learned a lot about Eric Poon.
  I stayed for another hour to celebrate his birthday and got the opportunities to speak with his family with a slice of cake.
  Reflection...
  To conclude the documentary I learned a lot about Eric. From my perspective everyone is different in various ways. The Psychiatrist and I concluded
    the fact that Eric could be different, does not relate him to a mental illness. Eric explained the many reasons for his change, 
    he wanted to try new things, and become a different person from everyone's perspective. Instead of playing video games all the time
    he wanted to try sports like soccer, swim, and track. He didn't act the same through social media because he wanted people to 
    accept him for who he is now not before. Everyone thought he suffered trumatically from mental issues and didn't realize his sudden change.
    Not everyone could suffer from mental issue, but they could change is various ways through emotions, actions, and personality.
    I hope everyone could learn from this documentary to relect on the cause and effects of mental health.
